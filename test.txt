expressions : 
AngularJS expressions can be written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.

AngularJS expressions can also be written inside a directive: ng-bind="expression".

AngularJS will resolve the expression, and return the result exactly where the expression is written.

AngularJS expressions are much like JavaScript expressions: They can contain literals, operators, and variables.

Example {{ 5 + 5 }} or {{ firstName + " " + lastName }}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
module : 
An AngularJS module defines an application.

The module is a container for the different parts of an application.

The module is a container for the application controllers.

Controllers always belong to a module.

Directive
AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which you can use to add functionality to your application.

AngularJS lets you extend HTML with new attributes called Directives.

AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which offers functionality to your applications.

AngularJS also lets you define your own directives.

The ng-app directive initializes an AngularJS application.

The ng-init directive initializes application data.

The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

**When naming a directive, you must use a camel case name, w3TestDirective, but when invoking it, you must use - separated name, w3-test-directive

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can invoke a directive by using:

->Element name : <w3-test-directive></w3-test-directive>

->Attribute : <div w3-test-directive></div>

->Class : <div class="w3-test-directive"></div>

->Comment : <!-- directive: w3-test-directive -->

The legal restrict values are:
->E for Element name
->A for Attribute
->C for Class
->M for Comment (We've added the replace property in this example, otherwise the comment would be invisible.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scope
The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).

The scope is an object with the available properties and methods.

The scope is available for both the view and the controller.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Root Scope
All applications have a $rootScope which is the scope created on the HTML element that contains the ng-app directive.

The rootScope is available in the entire application.
